# Blackout
## Research Outline
### Abstract
What explains conflict escalation? Past studies find different factors impacting conflict escalation ranging from structural factors to economic shocks, and organizational compositions. Recent technological innovations affecting escalation potential has often been neglected by these studies. By implementing new standards regarding conflict escalation, using DiD/DiDiD methods with noble dataset on the Arab Spring in Tunisia, we argue that internet blackout is likely to increase/decrease the likelihood of conflict escalation. This research contributes to past literature in three ways: 1) we integrate different measure of conflict escalation to..., 2) we show that fast changing technological environment can be a key aspect in conflict research nowadays, and 3) implement natural experiment to build causality.

### Research Question
What explains conflict escalation?

### Unit of Analysis
TBD (1st administrative unit-day or 2nd administrative unit-day)

### Outcome
Conflict Escalation: Defined in three different ways
1) Tactical Escalation (Change in code of contention from nonviolence to violence)
    - Ordinal Coding
        - Protest to Protest
        - Protest to Riot
        - Protest to Terrorist attacks
2) Numerical Escalation (Change in numbers that constitutes contentious political event)
    - Number of Participants
        - Ordinal Coding
    - Number of Fatalities/Casualties
        - Numerical Coding

### Treatment
Blackout

### Scope
Tunisia 2010 (Q4) - 2011 (Q1)

### Method
TBD (DiD or DiDiD)

### Contribution
1) Newly defining the concept of escalation
2) Bridging digital repression literature with conflict escalation literature
3) Applying pseudo-experimental design for causal inference
