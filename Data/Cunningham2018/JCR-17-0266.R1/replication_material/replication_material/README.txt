The following materials have been provided to replicate the main analyses in "Integrating Conflict Event Data." authored by Karsten Donnay, Eric T. Dunford, Erin C. McGrath, David Backer, and David E. Cunningham appearing in the Journal of Conflict Resolution.

The folder contains the following materials. 

Scripts:

(1) "replication-simulation-tests.R" - offers code to replicate the simulation tests reported in Table 1. 

(2) "replication-conflict-event-data.R" - offers code to integrate data for Nigeria 2011, Libya 2014, and South Sudan 2015 replicating Figure 3 and Table 3 from the main analysis. It also runs the validation tool required to generate the results reported in Table 4.

Data:

(1) "Nigeria_2011.Rdata" -- provides data from ACLED, UCDP-GED, SCAD, and GTD for Nigeria 2011 along with the taxonomies used in the paper to integrate the data. In addition, spatial data is included for Nigeria, which is necessary to reproduce part of Table 3.

(2) "Libya_2014.Rdata" -- provides data from ACLED, UCDP-GED, SCAD, and GTD for Libya 2014 along with the taxonomies used in the paper to integrate the data.

(3) "SSudan_2015.Rdata" -- provides data from ACLED, UCDP-GED, SCAD, and GTD for South Sudan 2015 along with the taxonomies used in the paper to integrate the data.

Data and replication material for analyses presented in the online appendix are available upon request.
