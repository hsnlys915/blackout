R package MELTT for integration of conflict event data: ACLED, SCAD, GTD, UCDP-GED

Key variables from each dataset:

1) Date

2) Enddate (for episodic or campaign data)

3) lon&lat coordinates

4) taxonomy variables (actor, event, geoprecision)

- Taxonomies needs to be developed separately to make use of MELLT

Protocol

1) Specify spatial and temporal window

- In our case: Tunisia and Egypt 2010 Q4 to 2011 Q1

2) Load dataset with key variables intact

3) Execute Matching: For original article, they identified events within 3km and 1 day are same event

4) Data inspection: Ephasis on event-to-episode matches

5) Visualization

6) Validation
